        ## Re-vote Request for CYBERGOV Analysis
        
        Use this template to request that the CYBERGOV system re-evaluate a proposal. Re-votes are triggered when there are significant changes to the proposal content, new information that wasn't available during the original analysis, or legitimate concerns about the original evaluation.
        
        **Important:** The rationale you provide here will NOT be shared with the LLMs. All relevant information should be publicly available on the proposal page itself.

        Example:
        The proposal was significantly updated on [date] to include additional technical specifications that address the security concerns raised by the community. The original CYBERGOV analysis was based on an earlier version that lacked these crucial details.
        
        Key changes:
        - Added comprehensive security audit requirements
        - Reduced budget by 30% based on community feedback
        - Extended timeline to allow for proper testing
